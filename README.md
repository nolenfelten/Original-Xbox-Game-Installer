An old friend of mine and I used to play retro games all the time in high school.
I tried to offer my old Original Xbox as a gift, but it was insisted that I recieve something for it. (It has a bunch of LED's I put into it, also a clear case. It was a special Xbox)
So I thought it would be interesting to offer that instead of paying for the console, she could pay for a few hours of development for this application. 
It worked out very well. I got User Interface + Python work for my portfolio, she gets to build her collection, and we could release the code to the Original Xbox hackers community. Because they have done so much great work!! :)
